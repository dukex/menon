Introduction; course outline, mechanics, and expectations. Described finite automata, their formal definition, regular languages, regular operations, and regular expressions. Proved that the class of regular languages is closed under union. Started proving closure under concatenation.

Quickly reviewed last lecture. Introduced nondeterministic finite automata (NFA). Proved that NFA and DFA are equivalent in power. Proved that the class of regular languages is closed under concatenation and star. Showed conversion of regular expressions to NFAs.

Quickly reviewed last lecture. Showed conversion of DFAs to regular expressions. Gave a method for proving languages not regular by using the pumping lemma and closure properties. Introduced context free grammars (CFGs).

Quickly reviewed last lecture. Defined context free grammars (CFGs) and context free languages (CFLs). Defined pushdown automata (PDA). Gave conversion of CFGs to PDAs.  Stated the reverse conversion without proof.

Quickly reviewed last lecture. Proved the CFL pumping lemma as a tool for showing that languages are not context free. Defined Turing machines (TMs). Defined TM deciders (halt on all inputs).
