Buying and selling stock can have an enormous impact on our success as an investor.  The most important thing to learn from this lesson is the emotional decisions when selling stock can often lead to very poor results. \n\nWe learned that there are two major rules for knowing when to sell stock:\n\n1. We sell stock when we can trade the capital into an investment that will produce a larger return after accounting for the capital gains tax paid (state and federal). In addition, you'll want to ensure the risk assumed is comparable for the return received.\n2. We sell stock when the business changes its fundamentals. This could mean the way they manage debt. The future outlook for earnings is decreasing...etc\n\nAlthough the process of accounting for a change in assets is laborious, its purpose often results in enormous financial decisions. Mastering the techniques taught in this video will undoubtedly lead to your success as an intelligent investor.", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1jHqCKj0PUM/maxresdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2012-07-10T13:02:03Z", "provider_id": "1jHqCKj0PUM", "duration": 1, "position": 0, "course": "course-3-stock-investing-like-warren-buffett-advanced", "slug": "28-when-to-sell-stock-like-warren-buffett"}, {"name": "29.

Since the market price of the stocks you buy is dependent on the dividends and the growth of the book value, we can quickly learn that a company that grows it's book value at a faster pace is more valuable.\n\nWhen we assessed two different companies in the video, we created a situation where both companies had the exact same earnings. The difference between the companies was the size of their equity (or book value). When a company with a large amount of book value is compared to a company with less book value, the percent change in their growth will be much more difficult if earnings are similar.\n\nWhen a company consistently has a strong Return on Equity, we know as investors that the management of the company is properly reinvesting the earnings of the business into assets that will continue to grow the capital earned. This is very important since most of the earnings produced by a company are retained and not paid as a dividend. When a disciplined investor purchases companies with a sustained high ROE, their investments compound at a much higher rate than other assets. The great thing with purchasing companies with high ROEs is that it helps alleviate capital gains tax if the security is held for a long period of time.", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9DKX6Ib8agY/maxresdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2012-07-10T13:02:29Z", "provider_id": "9DKX6Ib8agY", "duration": 1, "position": 1, "course": "course-3-stock-investing-like-warren-buffett-advanced", "slug": "29-what-is-return-on-equity-warren-buffetts-favorite-number"}, {"name": "29PE.

Although volume won't help intelligent investors learn the intrinsic value of a company, it can be used as a tool to help predict market behavior.\n\nMany times investors can be fooled into believing that the market price of a stock is determined by all the shareholders. This idea is false. When we look at the volume of a company on an given day, we can quickly get a sense of how many traders are actually determine the price of a stock when we compare this number to the shares outstanding. This ratio, volume/shares outstanding, provides a good idea how many traders are moving away from the company and how many are coming into the company. When the company trades at a very low volume, we can generally say that the shareholder agree with the market price. Likewise, if the volume is very high, we can generally say that shareholders disagree with the market price.\n\nIn the video, we demonstrated this principal with Wells Fargo (WFC). When we looked at the historical market price for WFC, we learned that on the day where the volume was the highest in ten years, the market price was at an all time low. This idea of shareholders disagreeing with the market price when volume is relatively high is an important point that stock traders can use to their advantage. Always remember, volume can mean that the stock is over priced or underpriced. The peak or valley is for you to discern.", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qo0nhcmLOF8/maxresdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2012-07-10T13:04:28Z", "provider_id": "Qo0nhcmLOF8", "duration": 1, "position": 3, "course": "course-3-stock-investing-like-warren-buffett-advanced", "slug": "30-what-is-stock-volume"}, {"name": "31.

This is the profit the company has produced for the given time frame.  Although many use the net income to value a business, Warren Buffett takes a different approach, and calculates what he calls the Owner's Earnings.  \nIn order to understand the concept of Owner's Earnings, one must understand the two paths that the Net Income takes after it's produced.  The first path is a potential dividend payment.  Any funds that take this path are immediately valued as Owner's Earnings.  The remain amount of net income after the dividend payment is then used to invest back into the business. This money also has two paths.  This money can be used to reinvest into the maintenance and care of the already existing equipment, or it can be spent expanding the assets of the company.  If the funds flow in the first direction, called Capital Expenditures, little to no growth in the company's book value will occur.  If the funds flow in the second direction, the money will add new streams of income to the business and the asset will be added to the current equity of the business.  This second amount is added to the dividend and the total is referred to as the Owner's Earnings.\nIf a person would be interested in calculating the owner's Earnings, they could simply take the funds from the Operating Activities section on the Cash Flow Statement, and subtract it from the Capital Expenditures -- also found on the Cash Flow Statement.  \nRemember the true Owner's Earnings is nothing more than the book value growth and the dividends combined.", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KVCQFoj3vjM/maxresdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2012-07-20T12:43:06Z", "provider_id": "KVCQFoj3vjM", "duration": 1, "position": 7, "course": "course-3-stock-investing-like-warren-buffett-advanced", "slug": "34-warren-bufetts-owners-earnings-calculation"}, {"name": "35.
